SPK-RectPack
============

A Quartz Composer patch to spatially pack rectangles into a container rectangle. Wraps the MaxRectsBinPack algorithm and c++ implementation by Jukka Jylnki, available at https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack

Why you'd want that is easier seen than explained: http://vimeo.com/79714877

Two example compositions show its use. They're built around manipulating QC Structures in JavaScript, Kineme DataTools might be an alternative.

Developed for a http://tobyz.net/projects/screenrunner event; you can hire me for that or adventures afresh.
